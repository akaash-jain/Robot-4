# Robot-4
I built this during Computer Science in school. 
This project uses p5.js to draw a robot that follows you when you move the mouse.
It explores object positioning, user interaction and motion. 

I used transformations like `translate()` and `scale()` to control movement and size.
Open the sketch in the p5.js editor or a browser to try it out.
